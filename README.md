Lamar-Calc-Ex-V10
=================

This was my first foray into writing an app in iOS that was not an actual tutuorial. Is is based on a tutorial, the Simple Calculator App. 

I was not fond of those examples as they generally took 2 static fields with numbers and then did a process on them. I wanted mine to work like the default Calculator app found in iOS. Have the ability to do progressive calculations and using a single input field. 

Unfortunately, I did not start posting this from its inception, so you are not able to see some of the crazy coding I had gone through... 

Right now it only works for integers, has the keypad, 4 operator functions and clear button. But I think the "hard" part is done. What I believe is the proper logic is there, now time to build out some more funtionality.
